# weekly-intent-lead-processor
This project automates the extraction, filtering and transformation of lead records received through email over the past week. The script reads daily CSV attachments from emails matching a specific subject line, identifies valid leads based on predefined rules, and aggregates all unique leads into a single structured output sheet.
